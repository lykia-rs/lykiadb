# generic
- Test builders/factories
- Error codes
- Replace the current str interner (use a trait)

# planning
- Select
- Insert
- Update
- Delete

# planning.scope-building
- Input collections and projected fields flow
- Path check (if a path is valid)
- Identifier check (if an identifier is valid)
- Scope building
- Scope merging
- Output fields should be tracked and managed
- Aggregations should be matched with expressions
- Environment presence check
    - Check all the functions and variables
    - Overlaps with aggregation caller eval

# planning.order_by
- Order by has to be outside of select core

# planning.aggregation
- max(avg(a), avg(b)) wouldn't work since nested aggregations are not supported
- Group buckets should be accessible as in projection (currently shown as col_{i})

# execution.generic
- calling an undefined function does not return an error
- execution_row 
    - should not be cloned before passing to inter_fork
    - pass by reference when possible
- Map subquery expressions to selects
    - Expr tree nodes are used to represent subqueries
- Find a better solution for inter_fork
- scan_loop can use a lazy iterator as source
- output structure is vague
